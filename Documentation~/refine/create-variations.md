# Create variations of the generated texture

You can create variations of the generated texture. This is useful if you want to create a set of textures that are similar but not identical.

The number of variations that you can create depends on the number of **Images** that you set when you generated the original texture. For example, if you set to generate three images, you can create three variations.

To create variations, right-click the generated texture and select **Create Variations**.
