# Upscale the generated texture

The default resolution of a generated image is `512` x `512` pixels. If you want to use the texture for a larger model, you can upscale it to a 4x resolution of `2048` x `2048` pixels. For example, you have a highly detailed 3D table for a video game. If you want to apply a generated texture to this table, upscaling the texture to a 2k resolution ensures that the intricate details of the clothing are preserved and appear sharp.

To upscale the generated texture, right-click it and select **Upscale**. Upscaled textures have a **2K** indicator to distinguish them from the default textures.

> [!NOTE]
> You can't edit upscaled textures. To make changes, edit the original texture and upscale it again.
