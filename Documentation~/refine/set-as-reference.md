# Set as a reference image

You can set a generated texture as a reference image to generate new textures guided by the color and shape of the reference image. Unlike [creating variations](xref:create-variations), this approach allows you to specify a prompt for the refinement.

1. Right-click the generated texture and select **Set as Reference**. The selected texture appears in the **Reference Image** panel.
1. Enter a prompt to refine the texture.
1. Select **Generate**.
