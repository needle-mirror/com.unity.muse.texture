# View textures as PBR materials

Physically Based Rendering (PBR) is a rendering technique that simulates the interaction of light with materials in a more realistic and accurate manner. To see what your generated texture looks like in a 3D environment, view it as a PBR material. For more information about materials and PBR in Unity, refer to [Materials](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Materials.html).

To convert between a texture and a PBR material:

- To convert the texture to PBR material, right-click the generated texture and select **View as PBR Material**. The PBR material appears as a sphere in the **Generations** panel.
- To convert the PBR material back to texture, right-click the sphere and select **View as Image**.

To rotate the sphere, hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> **+** click and drag.
